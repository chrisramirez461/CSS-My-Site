            <h3>Front Web Development</h3>
            <p>In August of 2022, I immersed myself in the crazy world of web development as a part of
                <a href="https://usa.generation.org/" target="_blank">Generation USA</a> Full Stack Java 
                Developer cohort. There I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and my first coding language, 
                Javascript. After creating multiple mockup projects, I learned the basics of front web 
                development, but I had to put that on hold for a moment. Yet, in 2023 I continue to 
                develop my skills with UDEMY courses and self-practice.

            <h3>Cooking</h3>
            <p>
                I started cooking when I was very young, guided by my grandma. I remember the love and 
                passion she put into all her meals. Today, I try to replicate what she used to do. 
                Although I do not consider myself a Gordon Ramsay chef-level, I still believe my skills 
                in the kitchen are somewhat extraordinary. I love cooking Caribbean and Italian dishes, 
                although lately, I've tried cooking new meals in the Asian cuisine.
